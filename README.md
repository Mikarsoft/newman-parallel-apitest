# newman-parallel-apitest
It's a tool that allows you to test your api with multiple parallel calls.  
Export some collections json files from Postman and put them in the folder "PostmanJsonCollections" 
then choose and run one of the batch files, depending on how many times you want to run the tests. 
Wait until it's finished and you will get the results on your browser.
